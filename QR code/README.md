# Overview

Currently the project source is only available on github. But in the future
solutions maybe shared on website, and available to preview them.

# Solution Process

## Technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS
- FIGMA

This project not includes any framework of CSS and Javascript code yet. 
The main purpose, to try to copy the design, using the figma, and implement
it in HTML and CSS. 

## Issues

- I used the div in the boxing, instead of HTML5 tags
- The style code is embedded into the index files. Usually I prefer to code it in different file
- Maybe to refer id-s or class are not used properly

Any feedbacks are welcome!

## Resources
- www.w3schools.com
- [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

# Continued Development

- First of all practicing the clean code
- Improve my JavaScript and its frameworks
- Definetly not only Frontend, but learn backend technologies
- Solve the challenges, and build my portfolio, from [Frontend Mentor website](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
