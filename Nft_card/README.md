#Overview
This challenge only HTML and CSS based, but helped me to find out,
where I need to improve my skills. Although, I worked on it more weeks
but effectively it was 4hours.

# Solution Process
##Technologies
 * Figma
 * HTML
 * CSS

I didn't use any framework, any codes are written from scratch. 

## Issue
The main issue, was too styling the main image, together with eye.
